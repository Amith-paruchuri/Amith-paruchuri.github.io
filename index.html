        <p>
        Final year MBBS student at AIIMS New Delhi.  
        I work at the intersection of clinical medicine, bioinformatics, and artificial intelligence.
        My work spans multiomics analysis, medical imaging, digital pathology, and deep learning
        to decode disease biology from high-dimensional biomedical data.

<h2>Research Projects</h2>

<h3>Brain–Retina Biological Aging Coupling (Submitted to AAIC 2026)</h3>
<p>
This project investigates whether biological aging is reflected systemically across different
organs by studying the coupling between retinal and brain aging signatures. Independent aging
clocks were developed from retinal fundus imaging using pretrained foundation models and from
structural brain imaging features. The core objective was to determine whether deviations from
chronological age in these two modalities converge or diverge across the lifespan.
</p>
<p>
The analysis involved residualized modeling, interaction analysis, and spline-based nonlinear
regression to examine cross-modal relationships while accounting for age effects. This work
demonstrates how multimodal imaging can capture shared aging biology.

<h3>Astrocyte Transcriptomic Signatures in Alzheimer’s Disease and Tauopathies (AAIC 2026)</h3>
<p>
Using single-nucleus RNA sequencing, this study identifies shared and disease-specific astrocyte
states across Alzheimer’s disease and primary tauopathies. Clustering and differential proportion
analysis revealed distinct astrocyte phenotypes enriched in inflammatory, stress signaling, and
homeostatic pathways.
</p>
<p>
Pathway enrichment and spatial transcriptomic mapping were used to localize these astrocyte
states within brain regions, enabling identification of reactive phenotypes that differ across
disease proteinopathies.
</p>
<p class="tools">Tools: R, Seurat, SCENIC, clusterProfiler</p>

<h3>Lymphocyte Infiltration at Tumor Border in DLBCL (USCAP 2026)</h3>
<p>
This computational pathology project quantifies how lymphocytes infiltrate tumor borders in
DLBCL whole-slide images. Tumor and cellular compartments were segmented using deep learning,
and a transition zone band was created around tumor margins.
</p>
<p>
Spatial infiltration patterns were modeled as continuous curves and slope-based features were
extracted to objectively represent tumor–immune topology. These features capture biologically
meaningful spatial heterogeneity not visible through bulk immune density.
</p>

<h3>AML Transcriptomic Genomic Risk Score (ASCO 2026)</h3>
<p>
This work develops a transcriptome-derived genomic risk score capable of capturing immune
regulatory and leukocyte differentiation programs beyond traditional cytogenetic risk
stratification. Survival modeling and LASSO regression were used to derive gene signatures.
</p>
<p>
Differential expression and pathway enrichment analyses were used to characterize immune
signaling landscapes underlying adverse prognosis.

<h3>Immune Activation Index in Coeliac Disease (DDW 2026)</h3>
<p>
This study investigates mucosal transcriptomic landscapes in coeliac disease using differential
gene expression and immune deconvolution. An immune activation index was derived to quantify
mucosal immune state beyond histology.
</p>
<p>
Pathway enrichment highlighted inflammatory signaling, antigen presentation, and lymphoid
infiltration correlating with disease activity.

<h3>Dementia Stage Classification from MRI using MobileNet (AAN 2026)</h3>
<p>
Transfer learning using MobileNet was applied to structural MRI to classify stages of dementia.
Grad-CAM visualization was used to confirm spatial consistency of attention with disease-
relevant anatomical regions.

<h3>EEG Spectrogram Classification for Schizophrenia (AAAI 2026)</h3>
<p>
EEG signals were converted into spectrogram representations and classified using deep learning
architectures to develop an objective screening tool for schizophrenia, particularly suited for
low-resource settings.

<h3>Mitotic Cell Detection using SAM + ResNet</h3>
<p>
Mitotic figures are critical prognostic markers in several tumors. In this project, RGB crops
around cell coordinates were generated and fused with SAM-derived segmentation masks to train
a ResNet classifier for mitotic detection.
