<h2>🚀 Research & Projects</h2>


<div class="project">
<h3>🧠 Brain–Retina Biological Aging Coupling (Submitted to AAIC 2026)</h3>
<p class="desc">
This project investigates whether biological aging captured through retinal imaging
shares a systemic relationship with brain-derived aging signatures. Aging clocks were
developed independently from structural brain measures and retinal imaging features
extracted using pretrained foundation models. Cross-modal analysis was performed to
study whether retinal and brain age deviations exhibit convergence or divergence across
chronological age using regression and spline-based modeling.
<br><br>
<b>Tools:</b> Python, PyTorch, Imaging feature extraction, Statistical modeling

<h3>🧬 AML Transcriptomic Genomic Risk Score (Submitted to ASCO 2026)</h3>
<p class="desc">
A transcriptome-derived genomic risk score was developed using survival modeling and
LASSO regression to capture immune and leukocyte differentiation programs that
provide prognostic value independent of cytogenetics. Differential expression and
pathway enrichment were performed to understand immune signaling patterns associated
with survival risk.
<br><br>
<b>Tools:</b> R, limma, glmnet, survival analysis, clusterProfiler

<h3>🔬 Tumor Border Immune Infiltration in DLBCL (Submitted to USCAP 2026)</h3>
<p class="desc">
Whole-slide images were analyzed to quantify spatial immune infiltration patterns near
tumor borders. A transition zone band was constructed around tumor margins and
infiltration gradients were modeled as spatial curves to derive objective features that
capture tumor–immune topology.
<br><br>
<b>Tools:</b> Python, TIAToolbox, CellViT, OpenCV

<h3>🧫 Immune Activation Index in Coeliac Disease (Submitted to DDW 2026)</h3>
<p class="desc">
Duodenal transcriptomes were analyzed to characterize immune and epithelial programs.
Immune deconvolution was performed and an immune activation index was derived to
quantify mucosal immune activity beyond histology.
<br><br>
<b>Tools:</b> R, limma, xCell, pathway enrichment

<h3>🌌 Astrocyte Signatures in AD and Tauopathies (Submitted to AAIC 2026)</h3>
<p class="desc">
Single-nucleus RNA-seq was used to identify shared and disease-specific astrocyte
transcriptomic states across neurodegenerative proteinopathies. Cluster proportion,
differential expression, and pathway enrichment were performed with spatial mapping.

<h3>🧠 EEG Spectrogram Classification for Schizophrenia (Submitted to AAAI 2026)</h3>
<p class="desc">
EEG signals were converted into spectrogram images and multiple deep learning
architectures were evaluated to classify schizophrenia from controls using
high-confidence prediction thresholds.

RGB crops around nuclei were extracted from WSIs. Cell masks were generated using
Segment Anything (SAM) and fused with image crops to train a ResNet classifier for
mitotic figure detection, a key prognostic feature in multiple tumors.
